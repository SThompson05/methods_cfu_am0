# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

I'm most proud on figuring everything out. Although it feels cheating at times to use the
internet and to find solutions, I think that's something I just need to get over. I remember
speaking with Launa, and she mentioned that a lot of her time learning was doing just that.
Reading articles and watching YouTube videos. I guess by the end of the day as long as I 
complete the task it doesn't matter how I came up with the solution as long as I learned along
the way.

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?

It's nice to use because it can make the output dynamic and unique to the user. While
some of the information remains the same you can manipulate the pieces that you need to.
